This theme is designed to follow UNSW branding guidelines on a Drupal 7.x- install.

Place the unsw (theme) folder into the Drupal sites -> all -> themes directory.

Additional requirements:

Zen (version 7.x-) theme which can be downloaded from https://www.drupal.org/project/zen
Jquery Update, with the selected version of 1.7 or above, from https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update

It is designed to work with several other UNSW-CWU provided modules that can be found at:

https://github.com/UNSWCWU/UNSW-Custom-Modules

This theme is a responsive ZEN subtheme and requires a SASS compiler such as compass.
Edit the .scss files only and compile them to .css
A suggested way to do this is to navigate to the theme directory at e.g. /sites/all/themes/unsw and run compass watch

You can change the breakpoints, layout grid etc as per the standard Zengrids included in the
sass layouts subdirectory.
